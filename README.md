SSR Exploration Project - Boilerplate to get up and running quickly with Koa and React.

## Limitations

Note, this project is not intended to be used in production. It was developed as an exploratory exercise for implementing SSR via Koa and React. At this time, the project provides only basic support for server-side rendering and development of a React application served via Koa (the original purpose of the project). Future plans to fortify the project include (but are not limited to):

- Routing ✓ (via [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/))
- Unit testing ✓ (via [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/))
- Code splitting ✓ (via [loadable components](https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components))
- SSR route initial data loading
